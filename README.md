==================
Lab Work

In this lab I will develop a simple Web server and a Web client in Java

1.	The Web server is capable of processing only one request. Specifically, this Web server will
(i)	create a connection socket when contacted by a Web client
(ii)	receive the HTTP request from this connection
(iii)	parse the request to determine the specific file being requested
(iv)	get the requested file from the serverâ€™s file system
(v)	create an HTTP response message consisting of the content of the requested file
(vi)	send the response over the TCP connection to the requesting Web client

2.	Create a simple Web page and put it in the same folder as this Web server program.
3.	Run the Web server on the port 80 (or any other available port)
4.	Use any browser from the same computer or from a different computer on the same LAN to request the simple page from the Web server.
5.	Write a Web client to connect to the Web server to request the same Web page and display the HTML code of the page in plain text format
